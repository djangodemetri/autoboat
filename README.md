This project consists of creating a GPS guided boat that can take data on salinity, temperature, and turbidity of a body of water. It was commissioned by Sonoma Water Agency is a school project led by Dr. Nansong Wu
of Sonoma State University. 
The boat must:

1 Collect data for salinity, temperature, and turbidity of a water source and store that information on a microSD card. No data processing will occur on board because the employeer did not think it was necessary

2 Must follow a GPS set route

3 Be able to navigate and withstand turbulent water, (within reason)
